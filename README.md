# Doodle Classifier
This is a single layer Neural Network made with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) that classifies doodles into either pens or pineapples.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
In order to run this locally, you will need at least [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html), [Numpy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.2/users/installing.html) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

This project also uses the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install). I highly recommend downloading and installing it, though I'll add a python script to run in terminal soon.

### Try it out!
Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/zolastro/TFDoodleClassifier.git` and run the command `jupyter notebook` into the same folder. Then your default browser should pop-up. If not, just go to http://localhost:8888/tree.

The current code and guidelines are in the Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.ipynb notebook. Feel free to execute and modify the code! Press `Shift+Enter` in a block of code to execute it.

## About the data
All the data used in this project is available in [Quick Draw - The Data](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).
