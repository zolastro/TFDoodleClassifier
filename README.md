# Doodle Classifier
This is a single layer Neural Network made with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) that classifies doodles into either pens or pineapples.
## Getting Started
In order to run this locally, you will need at least [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html), [Numpy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.2/users/installing.html) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

This project also uses the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install). I highly recommend downloading and installing it, though I'll add a python script to run in terminal soon.
